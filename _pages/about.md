> I like to joke that I "work with models".

At **[Cash App](https://cash.app/)**, I am currently a **Staff Machine Learning Engineer** on a platform team that enables credit and underwriting decisions for several financial products responsible for over 60% of Cash App's total revenue. My professional passion is **getting ML into production software so that it can enable better customer experiences**- whether through making personalized offers for financial products, or explaining the results of ML decisions in a digestible way.

I graduated from Harvard College in 2017 and have 5 years of practical experience at the intersection of ML, Product and Software Engineering. My first hands-on experience with ML was during my college research in computational neuroscience. In my first job in consulting for **[Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.boozallen.com/)** in DC, I began applying ML to real-world problems at the Department of Transportation and US Air Force.

I moved to NYC to wear many hats as a Field Product Data Scientist at **[Enigma Technologies](https://enigma.com/)**, a Series C startup (at the time), because I wanted a greater amount of product ownership, and dove into developing an ML-first product, including software development cycles and product iteration.

My experiences in consulting and at a startup gave me the chance to work on a variety of different ML modeling techniques - deep learning, NLP, time series modeling - and instilled a **passion for using the {mathematically, technically, and ethically} best tools to help customers**. I believe that ML is inherently interdisciplinary and that the "secret sauce" that customers care about is not usually the most cutting-edge ML, but the product experience that the ML empowers.
